Schema Tab
----------

The :guilabel:`Schema` tab reports on the documents in the collections.
The report is based on :ref:`sampling of the documents
<compass-faq-sampling>` in the collection.

.. figure:: /images/compass/collection-schema.png
   :figwidth: 795px

To access the :guilabel:`Schema` tab for a collection, click on a
collection on the left hand pane and select the :guilabel:`Schema` tab.

Query Bar
---------

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/query-bar-results.rst

From the query bar in the :guilabel:`Schema` tab, you can specify the
query filter, and if you click the :guilabel:`Options`, you can also
specify query options.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/query-bar-type-schema.rst

.. tip::

   In the :guilabel:`Schema` tab, you can also use the Query Builder to
   enter a query into the query bar. For details, see
   :ref:`build-query`.

Charts
------

For a field, Compass displays the data types and values with various
charts. The data type information is on the left hand side; the field
value information is on the right.

Field with Single Type Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below is an example of a chart showing a field called ``last_login``
which contains data of type ``date``.

.. figure:: /images/compass/field-example.png
   :figwidth: 330px

Field with Multiple Type Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The charts also display a percentage breakdown for fields with varying
data types across documents. In the example below,
the chart shows the contents of a field called ``phone_no`` in which
81% of documents are of type ``string``, and the remaining 19% are of
type ``number``.

.. figure:: /images/compass/field-percentage-breakdown.png
   :figwidth: 330px

Missing Field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a collection contains documents in which not all fields contain
a value, the missing values display as ``undefined``. In the example
below, the field ``age`` has no recorded value in 40% of the sampled
documents.

.. figure:: /images/compass/field-sparsity.png
   :figwidth: 330px

Strings
~~~~~~~

Strings can appear in three different ways. If there are
entirely unique strings in a field, Compass shows a random
selection of string values from the specified field. Click
the circular refresh icon to see
a new set of randomly selected values from the field.

.. figure:: /images/compass/string-sample.png
   :figwidth: 755px

If there are only a few different string values,
Compass shows the strings in a single graded bar which
shows the percentage of the population of the string values.

.. figure:: /images/compass/string-sample2.png
   :figwidth: 742px

If there are multiple string values with some duplicates,
Compass shows a histogram indicating the frequency of
each string found within the field.

.. figure:: /images/compass/string-sample3.png
   :figwidth: 734px

.. note::

   Move the mouse over each bar to display a tooltip which shows the
   value of the string.

Numbers
~~~~~~~

Numbers are similar to strings in their representation.
Entirely unique numbers are shown in the following manner:

.. figure:: /images/compass/number-sample.png
   :figwidth: 764px

Duplicate numbers are shown in a histogram that indicates their
frequency:

.. figure:: /images/compass/number-sample2.png
   :figwidth: 762px

Dates and ObjectIDs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fields that represent dates (and fields that contain the ObjectID
data type, which includes a timestamp) are shown across multiple
bar charts. The two charts on the top row represent the day of the
week and time of day of the timestamp value.

The single chart on the bottom shows the first and last timestamp
value, and the vertical lines represent the distribution of the
timestamp across the range of first to last.

.. figure:: /images/compass/date-sample.png
   :figwidth: 720px

Embedded Documents and Arrays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fields that contain a sub-document or an array are displayed with
a small triangle next to them and a visual representation of the
data contained within the sub-document or array.

.. figure:: /images/compass/embedded-document-sample.png
   :figwidth: 662px

Click on the triangle to expand the field and view the embedded
documents:

   :figwidth: 748px

GeoJSON and ``[latitude,longitude]`` Arrays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fields that contain GeoJSON data or ``[latitude,longitude]`` arrays are
displayed with interactive maps.

.. figure:: /images/compass/geo-visualization.png

View Charts of Mixed Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a field has mixed types, you can view different charts of each type
by clicking on the ``type`` field. In the example below, the ``age``
field shows the values that are strings:

.. figure:: /images/compass/mixed-sample.png
   :figwidth: 574px

Clicking on the ``number`` type causes the chart to show its numeric
data:

   :figwidth: 576px


.. _build-query:

Query Builder
-------------

In the :guilabel:`Schema` tab, you can type the filter manually into
the query bar or generate the filter with the Compass query builder.

.. tip::

   You can compose the initial query filter by using the clickable query
   builder and then manually edit the generated filter to your exact
   requirements.

Composing ``$OR`` filter conditions is not yet possible with the
clickable query builder, but you can manually enter them in the query
bar.

.. include:: /includes/steps/create-query-via-builder.rst

.. note:: 

   You can also use the query builder on data represented as maps.

.. |query-build-type| replace:: :ref:`build-query`
