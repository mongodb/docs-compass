Types and Missing Fields
------------------------

Compass displays the data types of fields in a
database's collection. Below is an example of a chart
showing a field called ``last_login``
which contains records of type ``date``.

.. figure:: /images/compass/field-example.png
   :figwidth: 330px

The charts also display a percentage breakdown for fields with varying
data types across documents. In the example below,
the chart shows the contents of a field called ``phone_no`` in which
81% of documents are of type ``string``, and the remaining 19% are of
type ``number``.

   :figwidth: 330px

If a collection contains documents in which not all fields contain
a value, the missing values display as ``undefined``. In the example
below, the field ``age`` has no recorded value in 40% of the sampled
documents.

Understanding the charts
------------------------

There are different charts for each data type in Compass.

Strings
~~~~~~~

Strings can appear in three different ways. If there are
entirely unique strings in a field, Compass shows a random
selection of string values from the specified field. Click
the circular refresh icon to see
a new set of randomly selected values from the field.

If there are only a few different string values,
Compass shows the strings in a single graded bar which
shows the percentage of the population of the string values.

If there are multiple string values with some duplicates,
Compass shows a histogram indicating the frequency of
each string found within the field.

  :figwidth: 615px

Note: mousing over each bar displays a tool tip showing
the value of the string.

Numbers
~~~~~~~

Numbers are similar to strings in their representation.
Entirely unique numbers are shown in the following manner:

Duplicate numbers are shown in a histogram that indicates their
frequency:

Sub-documents and Arrays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fields that contain a sub-document or an array are displayed with
a small triangle next to them and a visual representation of the
data contained within the sub-document or array.

.. figure:: /images/compass/subdocument-sample.png
  :figwidth: 572px

Click on the triangle to expand the field and view the sub-documents
within:

Dates and ObjectIDs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fields that represent dates (and fields that contain the ObjectID
data type, which includes a timestamp) are shown across multiple
bar charts. The two charts on the top row represent the day of the
week and time of day of the timestamp value.

The single chart on the bottom shows the first and last timestamp
value, and the vertical lines represent the distribution of the
timestamp across the range of first to last.

Viewing charts of mixed types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a field has mixed types, you can view different
charts of each type by clicking on the ``type`` field.
In the example below, the ``age`` field shows its values
as a string:

.. figure:: /images/compass/mixed-sample.png
  :figwidth: 602px

Clicking on the ``number`` type causes the chart to show
the data as a number:
