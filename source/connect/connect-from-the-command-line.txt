There are two ways to start |compass-short| from the command line:

- :ref:`Specify a connection string on the command line
  <compass-connect-cmd-line>`
- :ref:`Specify connection details in a file
  <compass-connect-file-based>`

If your connection string contains sensitive information, consider
using a configuration file to avoid exposing that information on
the command line.

.. _compass-executable-location:

Compass Executable Location
---------------------------

The name and location of the |compass-short| executable varies by
operating system. 

Linux
~~~~~
The executable is called ``mongodb-compass``. The installer installs it
in the ``/usr/bin`` directory. 

Windows
~~~~~~~

The executable is called ``MongoDBCompass.exe``. The installer installs
it in a folder you pick during the installation process.

MacOS
~~~~~
The executable is called ``Compass``. The installer installs
it under the Applications folder: 

.. code-block:: shell

   /Applications/MongoDB\ Compass.app/Contents/MacOS/MongoDB\ Compass

.. _compass-connect-cmd-line:

Command Line Connection Specification
-------------------------------------

The command line invocation for |compass-short| has two components, the 
path to the |compass-short| executable and a connection string. The
format is:

.. code-block:: shell
   :copyable: false
 
    <path/to/compass/executable> <connection string>

This example is like the basic connection string for a `MongoDB
University <https://learn.mongodb.com/>`__ training cluster. Modify the
connection details to connect to your MongoDB installation:  

.. code-block:: shell
   :copyable: false
 
   mongodb-compass mongodb+srv://cluster0.cpxklfq.mongodb.net/library
 

.. _compass-connect-file-based:

Configuration File Connection Specification
-------------------------------------------

The command line invocation for |compass-short| can specify a
configuration file. 

The format is:

.. code-block:: shell
 
   <path/to/compass/executable> \
      --file=<filename> \
      [--passphrase=<passphrase>] \
      [<connection id>]

The components of the command invocation are:

- The path to the |compass-short| executable
- A connection configuration file
- An optional passphrase for the connection configuration file
- An optional connection id

To create the connection configuration file, follow the steps to
:ref:`export the connection details <compass-export-connections-cli>`
from your Compass instance. The export process creates a file that
includes all of your favorite connections.

.. important::
 
   If you export your saved connections without using a passphrase, the
   configuration file contains the plaintext version of your username
   and password. Use a passphrase to encrypt the password.

To open |compass-short| and connect to your MongoDB instance, use a
command line like: 

.. code-block::
   :copyable: false

   mongodb-compass --file=learningConnectionFile \
                   --passphrase=superSecret

If you have multiple favorites, include the connection id from the
configuration file to specify which connection to use: 

.. code-block::
   :copyable: false

   mongodb-compass --file=multipleConnectionFile \
                   --passphrase=superSecret \
                   27ba0eda-c27e-46f5-a74a-2c041b1b58c4
