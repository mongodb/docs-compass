|compass-short| allows you to save MongoDB connection configurations to
easily reconnect to the same MongoDB deployment using the same
specifications.

Save a Favorite Connection
--------------------------

You can save a favorite connection from the initial
:ref:`connect screen <connect-run-compass>`, or after you have
successfully connected to a MongoDB deployment. Compass saves
favorite connections in the following directory depending on
your operating system:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 40
   
   * - Operating System
     - File Location

   * - macOS
     - ``~/Library/Application Support/<Compass Edition>/Connections``

   * - Windows
     - ``%APPDATA%/<Compass Edition>/Connections``

   * - Linux
     - Either:
     
       - ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/<Compass Edition>/Connections``
       
         or
         
       - ``~/.config/<Compass Edition>/Connections``

Once you save your favorite connection, |compass-short| displays the
connection in the :guilabel:`Favorites` section of the left navigation 
panel.
