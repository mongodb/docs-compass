|compass-short| allows you to save MongoDB connection configurations to
easily reconnect to the same MongoDB deployment using the same
specifications.

Save a Favorite Connection
--------------------------

You can save a favorite connection from the initial
:ref:`connect screen <connect-run-compass>`, or after you have
successfully connected to a MongoDB deployment.

panel.
