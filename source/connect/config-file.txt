Compass Configuration File 
==========================

You can configure |compass| settings using a :manual:`configuration file 
</reference/configuration-options>`. Configure settings with a configuration 
file to help manage the command line options for your large-scale deployments. 

Use Cases
---------

If you do not want your settings modified after startup, the configuration file 
allows you to configure settings for large deployments at startup and does 
not allow them to be modified afterwards on the |compass-short| interface. 

Behavior
--------

Be aware of the following information when configuring settings with a 
configuration file:

- You must create your own configuration file. |compass-short| does not provide 
  a default configuration file. For guidance on how to create a configuration 
  file, see :manual:`Configure the Database </administration/configuration/#configure-the-database>`.

- |compass-short| accepts EJSON or YAML configuration files.

- For macOS and Linux, the configuration file is located at ``/etc/mongodb-compass.conf``.

- For Windows, the configuration file is located at ``<path\to\compass>\..\mongodb-compass.cfg``.

- To view configuration options, run the following command in the folder 
  containing your |compass| executable:
  
  .. code-block:: sh

     <path-to-Compass-executable> --help

  .. note::

     The name and file path of the executable depend on your operating
     system. The preceding command is for macOS.

Tasks
-----

To see how to configure specific settings, see :ref:`Compass Configuration File Options 
<config-file-options>`.
