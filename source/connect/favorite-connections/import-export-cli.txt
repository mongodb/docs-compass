To quickly connect to a shared deployment, export and share your
favorite connections. Colleagues can import your favorites, or you can
use them yourself in your other workspaces.

By default, |compass-short| does not hide sensitive connection
information (such as usernames and passwords) from the exported
connection file. You can encrypt the exported file with a passphrase. If
you do, users must specify the passphrase to view the file contents.
