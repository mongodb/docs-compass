You can use the |compass-short| :abbr:`CLI (Command-Line Interface)` to
export and import favorite connections. This lets you share saved
connections between workspaces and with colleagues to quickly connect to
shared deployments.

By default, |compass-short| does not hide sensitive connection
information (such as usernames and passwords) from the exported
connection file. You can optionally encrypt the exported file with a
passphrase. When you do, users must specify the passphrase to view the
file contents.
