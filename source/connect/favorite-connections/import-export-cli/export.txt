You can use the |compass-short| :abbr:`CLI (Command-Line Interface)` to
export favorite connections. This lets you share saved connections
between workspaces and with colleagues to connect to shared deployments.

About This Task
---------------

When you export favorite connections, |compass-short| exports the list
of connections as a JSON file.

By default, |compass-short| does not hide sensitive connection
information (such as usernames and passwords) from the exported
connection file. To learn how to protect sensitive information in
exported connections, see :ref:`compass-encrypt-connections-cli`.

Procedure
---------

To export **unencrypted** favorite connections using the |compass-short|
:abbr:`CLI (Command-Line Interface)`, specify:

- The path to the |compass| executable. The path to the executable
  depends on your operating system.

- The ``--export-connections`` flag with the value set to the
  destination of the output file.

Your operation should resemble the following prototype:

.. code-block:: sh

   <path-to-Compass-executable> --export-connections=<filename>

Example
-------

This example exports favorite |compass-short| connections to a file with
the path ``/tmp/compass-connections/favorites.json``. Run the following
command in the folder containing your MongoDB Compass binary:

.. code-block:: sh

   ./MongoDB\ Compass --export-connections=/tmp/compass-connections/favorites.json
   
You will see this output:

.. code-block:: sh
   :copyable: false

   Exporting connections to "/tmp/compass-connections/favorites.json" (without passphrase)
   
.. important:: Output Contains Sensitive Information

   When you export favorite connections, the database username and
   password are included in plaintext, unless you :ref:`encrypt the
   export file <compass-encrypt-connections-cli>`.

Results
~~~~~~~

After the export completes, the
``/tmp/compass-connections/favorites.json`` file resembles the
following:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "type": "Compass Connections",
     "version": {
       "$numberInt": "1"
     },
     "connections": [
       {
         "id": "5a92e195-3ef5-49ae-aff6-720af362770d",
         "connectionOptions": {
           "connectionString": "<connection string>"
         },
         "favorite": {
           "name": "QA Cluster",
           "color": "color7"
         },
         "lastUsed": {
           "$date": {
             "$numberLong": "1663785601002"
           }
         }
       },
       {
         "id": "655f3e6e-b13b-4813-8578-50d896bd9240",
         "connectionOptions": {
           "connectionString": "mongodb://localhost:27017/"
         },
         "favorite": {
           "name": "Local Host",
           "color": "color7"
         },
         "lastUsed": {
           "$date": {
             "$numberLong": "1663790327679"
           }
         }
       }
     ]
   }
