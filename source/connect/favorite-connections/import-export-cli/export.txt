You can use the |compass-short| :abbr:`CLI (Command-Line Interface)` to
export favorite connections. Colleagues can import your favorites, or
you can use them yourself in your other workspaces.

About This Task
---------------

When you export favorite connections, |compass-short| exports the list
of connections as a JSON file.

By default, when you export favorite connections, database usernames and
passwords are included in plaintext. You may encrypt the exported file
with a passphrase. If you do, a user must specify the matching
passphrase to import the connections.

Procedure
---------

To export encrypted favorite connections with the |compass-short|
:abbr:`CLI (Command-Line Interface)`, specify:

- The path to the |compass| executable. The name and file path of the
  executable depend on your operating system.

- The ``--export-connections`` option set to the destination of the
  output file.

Your operation should resemble the following prototype:

.. code-block:: sh

   <path-to-Compass-executable> --export-connections=<filename>

Example
-------

This example exports favorite |compass-short| connections to a file with
the path ``/tmp/compass-connections/favorites.json``.

Run the following command in the folder containing your MongoDB Compass
executable:

.. code-block:: sh

   ./MongoDB\ Compass --export-connections=/tmp/compass-connections/favorites.json
   
.. note::

   The name and file path of the executable depend on your operating
   system. The preceding command is for macOS.

You will see this output:

.. code-block:: sh
   :copyable: false

   Exporting connections to "/tmp/compass-connections/favorites.json" (without passphrase)

Results
~~~~~~~

After the export completes, the
``/tmp/compass-connections/favorites.json`` file resembles the
following:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "type": "Compass Connections",
     "version": {
       "$numberInt": "1"
     },
     "connections": [
       {
         "id": "5a92e195-3ef5-49ae-aff6-720af362770d",
         "connectionOptions": {
           "connectionString": "<connection string>"
         },
         "favorite": {
           "name": "QA Cluster",
           "color": "color7"
         },
         "lastUsed": {
           "$date": {
             "$numberLong": "1663785601002"
           }
         }
       },
       {
         "id": "655f3e6e-b13b-4813-8578-50d896bd9240",
         "connectionOptions": {
           "connectionString": "mongodb://localhost:27017/"
         },
         "favorite": {
           "name": "Local Host",
           "color": "color7"
         },
         "lastUsed": {
           "$date": {
             "$numberLong": "1663790327679"
           }
         }
       }
     ]
   }
