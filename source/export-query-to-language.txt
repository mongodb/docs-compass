   to include the required import statements for the language selected.

#. *(Optional)*: Check the :guilabel:`Include Driver Syntax` option
   to include application code for the language selected. If you 
   include driver syntax, the copyable code reflects
   :ref:`project <query-bar-project>`, :ref:`sort <query-bar-sort>`, 
   :ref:`maxtimems <query-bar-max-time-ms>`, 
   :ref:`collation <query-bar-collation>`, :ref:`skip <query-bar-skip>` 
   and :ref:`limit <query-bar-limit>` options.

#. Click :icon-fa5:`copy` at the top-right of the formatted
