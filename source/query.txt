Building a query
----------------

There are two methods for building queries in Compass. You
can either type the query out manually, or you can
automatically generate queries with the Compass query
builder.

Using the clickable query builder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Click the chart values that you wish to include in a query

Each range of bars in the charts is clickable. Click on the
chart value and it builds a query with the
correct MongoDB syntax in the query bar. The example below shows
how to create a query for all documents where **EWR** is the departure
airport by clicking the **EWR** value in the chart for the
``departureAirportFsCode`` field.

Clicking on other field values creates a more complex query. The
following example shows how to extend the previous query to include
a flight ID.

It is also possible to select multiple values within the same field
by either clicking and dragging the cursor over a selection of values,
or by shift+clicking on the desired values.

You can also deselect a previously selected value by
shift+clicking on the highlighted value:

2. Click the Apply button and view the updated results

To run the query, click the Apply button. You can clear your query by
pressing the reset button.

The other method of building queries is to manually type the query in
the query bar. It is also possible to compose the initial query by
using the clickable query builder and then manually editing the
generated query to refine it to your exact requirements. Composing
``$OR`` queries is not yet possible with the clickable query builder,
but you can be manually enter them in the query bar.

Typing the query in the query bar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Type the query you wish to run in the query bar

You can type MongoDB queries into the query bar of
Compass. These queries are executed as find only, and must be
valid MongoDB syntax. 

.. figure:: /images/compass/query-bar.png
  :figwidth: 740px

The query bar will remain red until a valid query is entered, at which
point it will turn green and the query can proceed. The Compass screen
updates to indicate which field/value has been
selected in the query.

The results of the query are from a sampled set of documents, unless
the query is granular enough to provide results under the sample
threshold. In that case, the data from the entire result set is used.

Known issues:

- It is not possible to append a sort or a limit onto the end of your
  query.
- Aggregation framework queries are not yet supported.
- ``$text`` and ``$elemMatch`` are not yet supported.
- Non-standard BSON types such as ``Timestamp`` and ``MinKey`` must be
  entered using strict
  :manual:`extended JSON </reference/mongodb-extended-json/>` syntax.

.. code-block:: javascript

  { foo : { $timestamp : { $t : 1234, $i : 12 } } }

2. Click the Apply button and view the updated results

  :figwidth: 740px

As the above image shows, Compass updates its results to match the
query that was run. In this case, the query found documents where the
airport departure code was ``LGA``.

Click the Reset button to clear the results of the query.

Viewing indexes
---------------

Switch to the Indexes tab to view the indexes of a collection.

.. figure:: /images/compass/index-view.png
  :figwidth: 740px

**Name and definition** of an index: The name of the index and
whether the index is ascending or descending.

**Type of index:** Regular, text, geospatial or hashed index.

**Size of index:** How large the index is.

**Usage of index:** Number of times the index has been used
since the time the index was created or the last server restart.

**Properties of index:** Whether there are any special properties
of the index.

Viewing query execution (explain) plans
---------------------------------------

Switch to the Explain Plan tab to view the execution plan of a query.

.. figure:: /images/compass/query-plan.png
  :figwidth: 740px

Key information about the execution plan:

Check details in the raw output, also provided:

For more information about execution plans, please see the
:manual:`MongoDB documentation</tutorial/analyze-query-plan/>`.

New in Compass Beta 1.3: visualize explain stages
in a tree format. Each stage of the pipeline appears as a node
on the tree. This makes sharded cluster outputs 
easier to understand and visualize.

Viewing documents
-----------------

Use the Documents tab to view individual documents. When the Documents
tab loads, Compass displays all documents that match your query criteria
(or all documents within the sample if no query criteria was
specified).
