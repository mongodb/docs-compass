    Once Compass is running, an initial connection dialog appears:

      :figwidth: 626px

    The information requested is as follows:

    ``Hostname:`` The hostname of the machine where ``mongod`` is
    running. 

    ``Port:`` The port on which ``mongod`` is running.

    ``Authentication:`` Select an authentication mechanism to connect
    to the target host. 

    Supported auth mechanisms:

    - MongoDB-CR
    - SCRAM-SHA-1
    - Kerberos
    - LDAP

    ``SSL:`` Select whether Compass should connect to the target host
    via SSL or not.

    ``SSH tunnel:`` Select whether Compass should connect to a MongoDB
    cluster via SSH tunnel. If selected, choose either a password or
    an identity file to provide authentication.

    ``Favorite Name (Optional):`` A name for the
    connection. (When you use Compass in the future,
    previous connections appear in the left pane of this window
    under Favorites). 

    .. figure:: /images/compass/favorite-connections.png

    The above example shows a dialog window for a connection to
    a MongoDB server with authentication enabled.

    When the connection information is complete, click
    the Connect button to launch the main Compass window.

    Use the left pane to select a collection to examine.

    .. figure:: /images/compass/select-database.png

    After you select a collection, Compass begins
    analysis and shows the results.
    Note that the example below is specific to the selected collection.

    .. note:: 
      If the initial document analysis is slow, Compass
      will prompt you within 30 seconds and ask if you want
      to continue or quit.
