    Once Compass is :doc:`running </install>`, an
    initial connection dialog appears:

    .. figure:: /images/compass/connect-to-host.png
      :figwidth: 626px

    The information requested is as follows:

    .. list-table::
       :widths: 15 85

       * - Hostname
         - The hostname of the machine where ``mongod`` is running. 

       * - Port
         - The port on which ``mongod`` is running.

       * - Authentication
         - Select an authentication mechanism to connect to the target host. 

           Supported auth mechanisms:

           - MongoDB-CR
           - SCRAM-SHA-1
           - Kerberos
           - LDAP

       * - SSL
         - Select whether Compass should connect to the target host via SSL or not. For TLS/SSL connections to Atlas, select :guilabel:`Use System CA/Atlas Deployment`.

           - Certificate Authority File : Provide certificate(s) of one or more Certificate Authorities that you trust to validate the server's identity.
              For production use, your MongoDB deployment should use valid certificates generated and signed by a single certificate authority. You or your organization can generate and maintain an independent certificate authority, or use certificates generated by a third-party SSL vendor.

              To verify the identity of the MongoDB deployment you connect to, provide one or more certificates of trusted Certificate Authorities.

           - Client Certificate : If the server is configured to perform certificate validation, you need to provide a certificate here to identify yourself to the server.
             Typical file extensions for the certificate are .crt or .pem.

           - Client Private Key : If the server is configured to perform certificate validation, you need to provide the private key here to identify yourself to the server.
             Typical file extensions for the private key are .key or .pem.


       * - SSH tunnel
         - Select whether Compass should connect to a MongoDB cluster via SSH tunnel, which automatically start when you connect to MongoDB, and stop when you disconnect. If selected, choose either a password or an identity file to provide authentication.
    
           - SSH Hostname : Provide the hostname of the remote machine you want to connect to.
               This is the unique identifier (Fully Qualified Domain Name, or FQDN) for the machine to be accessed.

           - SSH Identity File : Select the file from which the identity (private key) for SSH public key authentication is read.

   
             On OS X using OpenSSH, identity files are found in ~/.ssh. By default, the filenames of private keys are one of the following.

               
                - id_rsa
                - id_ecdsa,
                - id_ed25519
                - id_rsa
                 

             On Windows, the location of identify files depends on your choice of SSH client. PuTTY is one commonly used SSH client.

           - SSH Passphrase : Optionally provide the passphrase used to decrypt your private keys (stored in the specified identity file).     
               A passphrase is used to decrypt your private keys, providing an extra layer of security for an SSH connection. This field is not required.

           - SSH Password : The password used to secure the SSH connection.
               This is required if you are not using an identity file.

           - SSH Tunnel Port : Provide the port used for the SSH connection.
               This defaults to 22, the standard port for SSH.

           - SSH Username : The username of the profile to log into on the remote system.
               This will be the user for which you want to establish the SSH connection.

    ``Favorite Name (Optional):`` A name for the
    connection. (When you use Compass in the future,
    previous connections appear in the left pane of this window
    under Favorites). 

    .. figure:: /images/compass/favorite-connections.png

    The above example shows a dialog window for a connection to
    a MongoDB server with authentication enabled.

    When the connection information is complete, click
    the Connect button to launch the main Compass window.

    Use the left pane to select a collection to examine.

    .. figure:: /images/compass/select-database.png

    After you select a collection, Compass begins
    analysis and shows the results.
    Note that the example below is specific to the selected collection.

    .. figure:: /images/compass/sample-results.png

    .. note:: 
      If the initial document analysis is slow, Compass
      will prompt you within 30 seconds and ask if you want
      to continue or quit.
