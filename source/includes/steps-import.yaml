  If you are importing a CSV file, you may select how your data 
  is delimited.

  For both JSON and CSV file imports, you can toggle 
  :guilabel:`Ignore empty strings` and :guilabel:`Stop on errors`:

  - If checked, :guilabel:`Ignore empty strings` drops fields with 
    empty string values from your imported documents. The document is 
    still imported with all other fields.

  - If checked, :guilabel:`Stop on errors` prevents any data from being 
    imported in the event of an error. If unchecked, data is inserted 
    until an error is encountered and successful inserts are not rolled 
    back. The import operation will not continue after encountering an 
    error in either case.
