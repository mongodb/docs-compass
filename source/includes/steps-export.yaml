  The export dialog initially displays the query entered in the query 
  bar prior to export, if applicable. If no query was specified, this 
  section displays a ``find`` operation with no parameters, which 
  returns all documents in the collection.

  To ignore the query filter and export your entire collection, select 
  :guilabel:`Export Full Collection` and click 
  :guilabel:`Select Fields`.
