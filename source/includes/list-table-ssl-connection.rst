   * - :guilabel:`Hostname`

     - The hostname of the machine where the ``mongod`` instance is
       running.

       .. tip::

          Starting with version 1.8.0, MongoDB Compass can detect
          whether you have a MongoDB
          :manual:`URI connection string </reference/connection-string>`
          in your system clipboard and auto-populate the connection
          dialog from the URI. Open MongoDB Compass with a URI
          connection string in your clipboard and click :guilabel:`Yes`
          when prompted to auto-populate the dialog.

   * - :guilabel:`Port`
     - The port on which ``mongod`` is running.

   * - :guilabel:`Authentication`

     - The authentication to use if the ``mongod`` instance
       requires authentication. Select:

       - :guilabel:`Username / Password` if the ``mongod`` instance
         uses either MongoDB-CR or SCRAM-SHA-1 as its
         authentication mechanism.

       - :guilabel:`X.509` if the ``mongod`` instance uses
         X.509 as its authentication mechanism.

         *Not Available in Compass Community Edition*

       - :guilabel:`Kerberos` if the ``mongod`` instance uses
         Kerberos as its authentication mechanism.

         *Not Available in Compass Community Edition*

       - :guilabel:`LDAP` if the ``mongod`` instance uses LDAP as
         its authentication mechanism.

         *Not Available in Compass Community Edition*

       For MongoDB access required, see :ref:`required-access`.

   * - :guilabel:`Replica Set Name`

     - The name of the MongoDB replica set to which you want to connect.

   * - :guilabel:`Read Preference`

     - Specifies how Compass directs read operations. Options are
       ``Primary``, ``Primary Preferred``, ``Secondary``,
       ``Secondary Preferred``, and ``Nearest``. See `Read Preference <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/read-preference/>`_.

   * - :guilabel:`SSL`

     - Select whether Compass should connect to the target host via
       TLS/SSL or not. Select:

       - :guilabel:`Use System CA/Atlas Deployment` to connect to
         `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?jmp=docs>`_.

       - :guilabel:`Server Validation` to have Compass validate the
         identity of the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance. If selected,
         you must provide

         .. list-table::
            :widths: 35 65

            * - *Certificate Authority File*

              - One or more certificate files from trusted
                Certificate Authorities to validate the
                certificate provided by the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
                instance.

       - :guilabel:`Server and Client Validation` if the
         :binary:`~bin.mongod` performs certificate validation from its
         clients and to have Compass validate the identity of the
         :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance. If selected, you must provide

         .. list-table::
            :widths: 35 65

            * - *Certificate Authority File*

              - One or more certificate files from trusted
                Certificate Authorities to validate the
                certificate provided by the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
                instance.

            * - *Client Certificate*

              - A TLS/SSL certificate to present to
                :binary:`~bin.mongod` to verify the identity of the
                Compass client. Typical file extensions for the
                certificate are ``.crt`` or ``.pem``.

            * - *Client Private Key*

              - A TLS/SSL key file to :binary:`~bin.mongod` to
                verify the identity of the Compass client.
                Typical file extensions for the private key are
                ``.key`` or ``.pem``.

            * - *Client Key Password*

              - If the *Client Private Key* is protected with a
                password/passphrase, you must provide the
                password/passphrase.

       - :guilabel:`Unvalidated` to use TLS/SSL without any identity validation.

       .. tip::
          For production use, your MongoDB deployment should use valid
          certificates generated and signed by a single certificate
          authority. You or your organization can generate and
          maintain an independent certificate authority, or use
          certificates generated by a third-party TLS/SSL vendor.

   * - :guilabel:`Favorite Name`

     - *Optional*. A name for the connection. To save the current
       connection entered as a favorite connection, enter a name
       in the input and click :guilabel:`Create Favorite`. For more
       information on favorite connections, see the
       :ref:`Favorite Connections <favorite-connections>`
       documentation.

       .. note::

          The :guilabel:`Create Favorite` button only appears once
          you have entered text into the :guilabel:`Favorite Name`
          input.

          Although you can save multiple connections with the same
          :guilabel:`Favorite Name`, it is recommended to use
          unique names for each connection to easily find your
          desired connections.
