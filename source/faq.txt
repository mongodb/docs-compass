What is the performance impact of running this tool?
----------------------------------------------------

Testing has shown that |compass| has minimal impact in prototype
deployments, though additional performance testing and monitoring is in
progress.

For best results, use MongoDB 3.2 or higher, which includes the
:pipeline:`$sample` operator for efficient sampling on a collection. On
older versions of MongoDB, |compass| falls back on a :ref:`less
efficient sampling method <compass_fallback_sampling>`.

You should only execute queries that are indexed appropriately in the
database to avoid scanning the entire collection.

What is sampling and why is it used?
------------------------------------

Sampling in |compass| is the selection a subset of data
from a particular collection and analyzing the documents within the
sample set.

Sampling is a common technique in statistical analysis because analyzing
a subset of the data gives similar results to analyzing all of it. In
addition, sampling allows results to be generated quickly rather than
performing a computationally-expensive collection scan.

How does sampling work?
-----------------------

|compass| employs two distinct sampling mechanisms.

In MongoDB 3.2, collections are sampled with the :pipeline:`$sample`
operator via the :manual:`/core/aggregation-pipeline`. This provides
efficient random sampling without replacement over the entire
collection, or over the subset of documents specified by a query.

.. _compass_fallback_sampling:

In MongoDB 3.0 and 2.6, collections are sampled via a
backwards-compatible algorithm executed entirely within |compass|. It
takes place in three stages:

1. |compass| opens a :term:`cursor` on the desired collection, limited
   to at most 10,000 documents sorted in descending order of the ``_id``
   field.
2. ``sampleSize`` documents are randomly selected from the stream. To
   do this efficiently, |compass| employs `reservoir sampling
   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling>`_.
3. |compass| performs a query to select the chosen documents directly
   via ``_id``.

``sampleSize`` is set to 100 documents.

.. note::
  The choice of sampling method is done transparently in the
  background, with no changes required by the user.

Won't sampling miss documents?
------------------------------

Sampling is chosen for its efficiency: the amount of time required to
perform a sample is minimal, on the order of a few seconds. Increasing
the sample confidence will demand more processing power and time.
Furthermore, sophisticated outlier detection requires an inspection of
every document in a MongoDB deployment, which would be unfeasible for
large data sets. The MongoDB team is in the process of conducting user
tests on large data sets to find a reasonable balance.
