What is the performance impact of running this tool?
----------------------------------------------------

Our tests have shown minimal performance impact on our test
database instances. We are
actively testing and monitoring performance profiles and
we will publish our findings and recommendations with the public
release later this year. It is not recommended to run Compass
in production or on mission-critical data.

How does sampling work?
-----------------------

We are currently experimenting with multiple sampling implementations.
So far,
`Reservoir Sampling <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling>`_
is the method that produces the best results.
Interested developers should join the discussion on the
:issue:`SERVER-533` JIRA ticket.

Won't sampling miss things?
---------------------------

The amount of time required to collect a data sample is usually only
a few seconds. Real outlier detection would
require an inspection of every document in the MongoDB
deployment, which could be prohibitively computationally expensive
on large datasets. We are in the process of conducting tests
to find the right balance of cost and confidence.
