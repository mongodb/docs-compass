How Your Data is Used
---------------------

When you query with natural language in Compass, the schema of the 
collection you are querying including the collection name, field names,

---------------------------------

Natural language querying in Compass is available if you have 
enabled the :ref:`Compass Use Generative AI setting 
<enable-natural-language-querying>` and logged 
into Atlas. If you no longer want to use the feature, you can ignore it 
and no data will be sent to generative AI models. To prevent usage of 
this feature entirely, you can disable it in the 
:ref:`global configuration file <config-file>`.
