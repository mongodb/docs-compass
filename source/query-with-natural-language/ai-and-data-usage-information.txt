Querying with natural language in Compass is powered by Generative AI
(Gen AI), and may give inaccurate responses. See our `Generative AI FAQ 
<https://dochub.mongodb.org/core/faq-ai-features>`__ 
for more information about Gen AI in MongoDB products.

Third Party Providers
---------------------

Querying with natural language in Compass currently uses the `Azure OpenAI Service
<https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service>`__ 
hosted by Microsoft.  This is subject to change in the future. 

How Your Data is Used
---------------------

When you query with natural language in Compass, the following 
information is sent to MongoDB's backend and/or the third party 
AI provider: 

- The schema of the collection you are querying 
  (including collection name, field names, and types). 

- The information that is sent will not be shared with any other third 
  parties or stored by the AI provider. We do not send database 
  connection strings, credentials, or rows/documents from your databases. 

Disable Natural Language Querying
---------------------------------

- Natural language querying in Compass is available if you have 
  enabled the :ref:`Compass Use Generative AI setting 
  <enable-natural-language-querying>` and logged into Atlas. 
- If you no longer want to use the feature, you can ignore it 
  and no data will be sent to generative AI models. To prevent usage of 
  this feature entirely, you can disable it in the 
  :ref:`global configuration file <config-file>`.
