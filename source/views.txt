Views are read-only results of an
:ref:`aggregation <compass-agg-builder>` run against a collection.
Views provide easy access to the results of an aggregation
without requiring the reader of the view to execute the pipeline.
Views can also help keep your data secure by only giving users
access to a predefined result set,
as opposed to having access to the underlying collection.

|compass-short| displays views in the :ref:`Collections Screen <collection-tab>` with
a special icon, and indicates the collection from which
the view was created.

Create a View
-------------

To create a view, you must use the :ref:`compass-agg-builder`.
The output of your pipeline's final stage becomes the content of
the view.

To create a view from your pipeline results:

1. Create an aggregation pipeline in the pipeline builder.

#. Click the arrow next to the :guilabel:`Save` button at the top
   of the pipeline builder.

#. Click :guilabel:`Create a View`.

#. Enter a name for your view.

#. Click :guilabel:`Create`.

|compass-short| creates a view from your pipeline results in the same
database where the pipeline was created.

Open a View
-----------

To open a view, either:

- Click the desired view from the
  :ref:`Collections screen <collections-screen>`, or

- Click the desired view in the left-hand navigation.

After you open a view, |compass-short| shows you that
view's :doc:`Documents Tab </documents>`. |compass-short| provides the following
information and functionality for the view:

- :doc:`/documents`
- :ref:`compass-agg-builder` to aggregate based on your view
- :doc:`/schema` *Not Available in Compass Community Edition*
- :doc:`/query-plan`
