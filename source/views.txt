Views are read-only results of an
:ref:`aggregation <compass-agg-builder>` run against a collection.
Views provide easy access to the results of an aggregation
without requiring the reader of the view to execute the pipeline.
Views can also help keep your data secure by only giving users
access to a predefined result set,
as opposed to having access to the underlying collection.

Collections Screen
------------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-collections-screen.rst

|compass-short| displays views in the :guilabel:`Collections Screen`
with a special icon, and indicates the collection from which the view
was created.

View Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Collections` screen displays the following information
for each view in the selected database:

- View name
- Collection from which the view was created
- Total size of all documents in the view
- Total size of all indexes on the collection

Create a View
-------------

To create a view, you must use the :ref:`compass-agg-builder`.
The output of your pipeline's final stage becomes the content of
the view.

To create a view from your pipeline results:

1. Create an aggregation pipeline in the pipeline builder. For detailed
   instructions on using the pipeline builder, see
   :ref:`create-agg-pipeline`.

#. Click the arrow next to the :guilabel:`Save` button at the top
   of the pipeline builder.

#. Click :guilabel:`Create a View`.

#. Enter a name for your view.

#. Click :guilabel:`Create`.

|compass-short| creates a view from your pipeline results in the same
database where the pipeline was created.

Open a View
-----------

To open a view, either:

- Click the desired view from the
  :ref:`Collections screen <collections-screen-views>`, or

- Click the desired view in the left-hand navigation.

After you open a view, |compass-short| shows you that
view's :doc:`Documents Tab </documents>`. |compass-short| provides the following
information and functionality for the view:

- :doc:`/documents`
- :ref:`compass-agg-builder` to aggregate based on your view
- :doc:`/query-plan`
- :doc:`/indexes`
- :doc:`/schema` (*Not Available in Compass Community Edition*)
- :doc:`/validation` (*Not Available in Compass Community Edition*)

Duplicate a View
----------------

You can duplicate a view to modify an existing view while retaining the
original.

To duplicate a view:

1. Hover over the desired view in the left navigation.

#. Click the appearing :guilabel:`Ellipses (...)` button.

#. In the dropdown, click :guilabel:`Duplicate View`.

#. Enter a name for the new view.

#. Click :guilabel:`Duplicate`.

Modify the Source of a View
---------------------------

.. note:: Considerations

   Views are read-only, and cannot inherently be modified. This
   procedure describes modifying the *underlying source* of a view.

   When you modify a view, |compass-short| cannot retain collation
   information associated with the view. Any collation information
   must be re-entered in the pipeline builder during modification.

To modify the source of a view:

1. Click the desired view in the left navigation.

#. At the top of the view, click :guilabel:`Modify Source`. This
   button opens the
   :ref:`aggregation pipeline builder <compass-agg-builder>` and
   populates the pipeline used to create the view.

#. Modify the pipeline as desired. For detailed
   instructions on using the pipeline builder, see
   :ref:`create-agg-pipeline`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Update View` at the top of the pipeline builder.

Drop a View
-----------

To drop a view from the database:

1. Hover over the desired view in the left navigation.

#. Click the appearing :guilabel:`Ellipses (...)` button.

#. In the dropdown, click :guilabel:`Drop View`.

#. In the modal, enter the name of the view.

#. Click :guilabel:`Drop Collection`.




|compass-short| explicitly marks views in the left navigation with
a unique icon:
