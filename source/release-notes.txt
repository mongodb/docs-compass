- New and improved :ref:`Connection <connect-run-compass>` experience
  with support for all connection options.

- Improved user experience for saving and sharing 
  :ref:`Favorite Connections <favorite-connections>`.

- Added JSON mode for managing documents. With JSON mode, you can
  now insert multiple documents at once.

- Added support for querying UUIDs via the 
  :ref:`Documents <documents-tab>` query bar or in the
  :ref:`Aggregation Pipeline Builder <compass-agg-builder>`.

  - :manual:`$unset </reference/operator/aggregation/unset/>`

  - :manual:`$replaceWith </manual/reference/operator/aggregation/replaceWith/>`

  collections, even when sample mode was disabled.
