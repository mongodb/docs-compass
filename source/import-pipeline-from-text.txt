You can import aggregation pipelines from plain text into
the :ref:`Aggregation Pipeline Builder <compass-agg-builder>` to
easily modify and execute your pipelines. Importing a plain text
aggregation pipeline shows how each stage of the pipeline
affects the output, and illustrates the effects of modifying specific
pipeline stages using the Pipeline Builder's :guilabel:`Output` panes.

Syntax
------

The imported pipeline must be in the
:manual:`MongoDB query language </tutorial/query-documents/>`
(i.e. the same syntax used as the ``pipeline`` parameter of the
:manual:`db.collection.aggregate()
</reference/method/db.collection.aggregate/>` method). The imported
pipeline must be an array, even if there is only one stage in the
pipeline.

Procedure
---------

.. important::

   Importing a new pipeline abandons any unsaved changes to the
   pipeline you are currently working on. If the circle at the
   top-right of the :guilabel:`Aggregations` view is orange, this
   means you have unsaved changes to your pipeline.

.. include:: /includes/steps/import-pipeline-from-text.rst

Once you have imported your pipeline, if :guilabel:`Auto Preview` is
enabled, the pipeline automatically executes. You can now modify
individual stages of your pipeline, and see the results of those
modifications reflected in the :guilabel:`Output` pane to the right
of each respective stage.
