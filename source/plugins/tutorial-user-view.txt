Introduction
------------

This tutorial demonstrates how to create a basic Compass plugin which
displays the :manual:`users </core/security-users/>` of a database and
their :manual:`roles </core/authorization/>`.

This plugin will be implemented with the
:ref:`Database.Tab <plugin-ref-database-tabs>` role, meaning it will
reside in its own tab in the |compass| database view.

Creating the Plugin
-------------------

Set Up
~~~~~~

See :ref:`plugins-install-dependencies` to install the prerequisites for
writing |compass| plugins.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/plugin-instantiate-users.rst

When prompted, enter the following values:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 60

   * - **Field**
     - **Description**

   * - Name
     - ``users``

   * - Description
     - Displays database users and their respective roles.

   * - Role
     - :ref:`Database.Tab <plugin-ref-database-tabs>`

Finally, run the following command to install the plugin's dependencies:

.. cssclass:: copyable-code
.. code-block:: sh

   cd users && npm install

Creating the Store
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-tutorial-create-store.rst

The user plugin's store is called ``UsersStore``, and it keeps the
following state variables:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 60

   * - ``users``
     - An array of objects representing the users of the currently
       selected database. For details on the fields returned in these
       objects, see :ref:`User Object <user-object>`.

   * - ``database``
     - A string representing the name of the currently selected
       database. This string is used in the *store* to filter
       the users displayed. Compass will only display users whose
       authentication database is the database currently being viewed.

   * - ``error``
     - An :abbr:`optional (may be null)` object containing error
       information.


.. _user-object:

User Object
```````````

The objects in the ``users`` state variable take the following form:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 60

   * - ``_id``
     - A unique identifier for the user, incorporating the user's name
       and authentication database.

   * - ``user``
     - The user's username.

   * - ``db``
     - The database on which the user was created.

   * - ``roles``
     - An array of objects representing the
       :manual:`roles </core/authorization/>` of the user and the
       databases in which those roles apply.

.. note ::

   A user can have roles pertaining to different databases than the
   one on which they were created. For more information on roles, see
   :manual:`Role-Based Access Control </core/authorization/>`.

Implementing the Store
``````````````````````

Update ``src/stores/store.js`` to match the following:

.. cssclass:: copyable-code
.. literalinclude:: example-user-view/store.js
   :language: js
   :linenos:

Creating the Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The users view contains a *component*, which is a view which renders
based on the ``UsersStore`` store.

Update ``src/components/users/users.jsx`` to match the
following:

.. cssclass:: copyable-code
.. literalinclude:: example-user-view/users.jsx
   :language: jsx
   :linenos:

This component displays a table showing each user whose authentication
database is the database currently being viewed, along with all of the
roles assigned to that user.
