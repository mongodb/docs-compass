Starting in |compass| 1.31, you can load saved queries and aggregations from 
the :guilabel:`My Queries` view once you are connected to your cluster.
This page explains how to add and view favorite queries and 
aggregations.

Saving an Aggregation Pipeline
------------------------------

You can save a pipeline so that you can find it later. If you
load a saved pipeline, you can change it without
changing the original saved copy. You can also create a :ref:`view
<view-details>` from your pipeline results.

To save your pipeline: 

.. include:: /includes/fact-save-pipeline.rst
