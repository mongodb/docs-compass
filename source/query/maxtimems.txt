========================================
Adjust Maximum Time for Query Operations
========================================

You can modify the :guilabel:`MaxTimeMS` query bar option to adjust
the cumulative time limit in milliseconds to process query bar
operations. If the time limit is reached before the operation completes,
|compass-short| interrupts the operation.

The default :guilabel:`MaxTimeMS` value is ``5000``. Consider raising
this value if you have a very large collection, or your operations
are frequently timing out. You can also consider creating
:ref:`indexes <compass-indexes>` to improve query performance.
