|compass-short| collects anonymous aggregated usage data to improve
MongoDB products. |compass-short| collects this information by default,
but you can disable this data collection at any time.

- The type of MongoDB deployment |compass-short| is connected to. For
  example, Enterprise Edition, Community Edition, or Atlas Data Lake.

- User actions performed in |compass-short|, such as creating
  collections and indexes. |compass-short| only tracks the general
  action performed, and does not track field values or namespaces.

- Errors.

- Queries run in |compass-short|.

- Data stored in your MongoDB deployment.

- A :ref:`command line option <cli-options>`

- A :ref:`configuration file <config-file>`
