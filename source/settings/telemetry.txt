|compass-short| collects anonymous aggregated usage data to improve
MongoDB products. |compass-short| collects this information by default,
but you can disable this data collection.

About this Task
---------------

- The type of MongoDB deployment |compass-short| is connected to. For
  example, Enterprise Edition, Community Edition, or Atlas Data Lake.

- User actions performed in |compass-short|, such as creating
  collections and indexes. |compass-short| only tracks the general
  action performed, and does not track field values or namespaces.

- Errors.

|compass-short| *does not* track:

- IP addresses, hostnames, usernames, or credentials.

- Queries run in |compass-short|.

- Data stored in your MongoDB deployment.

- Personal identifiable information.
