MongoDB Compass
===============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

|compass| is a tool that helps you visually analyze and understand your
MongoDB data. It provides users with a graphical view of their MongoDB
schema without requiring use of
:manual:`query language </tutorial/query-documents>`

In MongoDB, :term:`collections <collection>` do not enforce a
rigidly-defined :term:`document` structure. This can make it difficult
to explore and understand the underlying data and its structure without
a tool such as |compass|.

To ensure minimal impact on your database's performance,
|compass| randomly samples a subset of documents from the collection.
For more information on sampling, see the
:ref:`FAQ <compass-faq-sampling>`.
