.. admonition:: |compass| is available in the following versions

   - General Availability.

   - Beta Version.

   - Readonly Version (*New in version 1.12.0*).

   To download any available version, go to the `MongoDB Download

|compass| is designed to allow
users to easily analyze and understand the contents of
their data collections within MongoDB and
perform queries, without requiring knowledge of MongoDB
:manual:`query syntax </tutorial/query-documents>`.

|compass| provides users with a graphical view of their MongoDB
schema by randomly sampling a subset of documents from the
collection. Sampling documents minimizes
performance impact on the database and can produce results quickly.
See the :ref:`FAQ<compass-faq-sampling>`
for further information on sampling.
