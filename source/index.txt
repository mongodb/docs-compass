Disclaimer
----------

|compass| is currently generally available for 
`version 1.2
<https://www.mongodb.com/downloads#compass>`_ and
in beta for version 1.3. This document provides guidance on using
all features available in both versions, and identifies features which
are currently in beta. Please report bugs and provide feedback to
`compass@mongodb.com <mailto:compass@mongodb.com>`_.

Overview
--------

Data in MongoDB has a flexible schema. :term:`Collections <collection>`
do not enforce a
rigidly defined :term:`document` structure and the schema of a
collection is
not defined or available for inspection within the database. MongoDBâ€™s
flexible schema and rich document structure make developers more
productive, but they also make it difficult to explore and understand
the underlying data and its structure.

Previously, users wishing to understand the shape of their data
had to connect to the MongoDB shell and write queries to investigate
document structure, field names, and data types.

MongoDB 3.2 introduces |compass|, a tool designed to allow
users to easily analyze and understand their schema within MongoDB and
perform queries, without requiring knowledge of MongoDB
:manual:`query syntax </tutorial/query-documents>`.

|compass| provides users with a graphical view of their MongoDB
schema by randomly sampling a subset of documents from the
collection. Sampling documents minimizes
performance impact on the database and can produce results quickly.
See the :ref:`FAQ<compass-faq-sampling>`
for further information on sampling.
