You can change the data type of a field by using the data type
selectors on the right of the field. The following example shows
an array with three strings:

To change the ``_id`` field to use a custom value, change
the data type from ``ObjectID`` to ``string`` and then overwrite the
``_id`` value:

Cloning documents
-----------------

It is also possible to insert new documents by cloning
the schema and values of an existing document in a collection.

To clone a document, hover over the desired document
and click the ``Clone`` button.

This creates a new insert dialog with the same schema
and values. You can edit any of these fields and values before
you insert the new document.

of values. You can delete fields by selecting the ``x`` icon to the
left of the field:

To insert a new field, click or tab to the end of the document and
fill in the field/value. New fields appear highlighted in green:

values and making changes. In this example, the flight status was
changed from ``L`` to ``M``. Changed fields appear highlighted in

button to commit your changes.
