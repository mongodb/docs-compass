View Documents
--------------

Use the Documents tab to view the documents inside of a collection.
Two different views are available to access documents: List View and
Table View.

List View is the default document view. To switch to Table View, click
the :guilabel:`Table` button to the right of the :guilabel:`List`
button to access the document Table View.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: List View
      :tabid: list-view

      List View shows documents as individual members in a list
      format.

      .. figure:: /images/compass/doc-view.png

      Expand Embedded Objects and Arrays
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      To toggle the expansion of embedded objects and array elements in
      a document, hover over the target document and click the arrow in
      the top-left corner.

      Encrypted Fields
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      .. include:: /includes/fact-fle-description.rst

      .. figure:: /images/compass/encrypted-fields-list.png
         :figwidth: 696px
         :alt: Encrypted field in list view

   .. tab:: Table View
      :tabid: table-view

      Table view shows documents as rows of a table. The document
      fields are shown in the table columns.

      .. figure:: /images/compass/doc-table-view.png
         :figwidth: 696px

      You can reorder the table columns by clicking and dragging the
      column headings. Reordering the columns is a strictly cosmetic
      change and does not change the underlying data itself.

      Expand Embedded Objects and Arrays
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      To view nested object fields and array elements, hover your
      cursor over a field with a value type of ``Object`` or ``Array`` and click the
      button with outward-pointing arrows which appears on the right side of
      the field.

      |compass-short| opens a new tab in the Table View corresponding
      to the nested element.

      .. figure:: /images/compass/table-view-expand-nested-elem.png
         :figwidth: 696px

      The following example displays the ``delays``
      object nested within the ``flightStats`` collection documents. The
      new tab displays the two properties of the ``delay`` object:
      ``arrivalRunwayDelayMinutes`` and ``departureRunwayDelayMinutes``.

      .. figure:: /images/compass/doc-table-view-nested.png
         :figwidth: 696px

      To return to the original table display, click on the first tab
      in the Table View which displays the name of your collection.

.. _insert-documents:

Insert Documents
----------------

Click the :guilabel:`Insert Document` button to insert a new document:

.. figure:: /images/compass/insert-button.png
  :figwidth: 816px

The insert dialog appears:

.. figure:: /images/compass/insert-document.png
  :figwidth: 598px

For each field in the document, select field type and fill in the
field name and value.

.. figure:: /images/compass/insert-document2.png
  :figwidth: 627px

.. tip::

   For the field values, you can paste valid JSON that can be parsed by
   JavaScript's ``JSON.parse``.

   - If the pasted JSON is an Array, the first character must be a left
     bracket ``[`` and the last character must be a right bracket ``]``:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        [ "first", "second", 3 ]

   - If the pasted JSON is an Object (i.e. a document), the keys must
     be quoted in double quotes and are permitted to be escaped. The
     first character must be left curly brace ``{`` and the last must
     be right curly brace ``}``:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        {
          "email": "test@example.com",
          "phone": "555-555-1212"
        }

Add New Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add a new field for the document, hover over the row number in the
dialog (the row number is not part of the document but the dialog
display) and click on the plus sign add a new field after the field.

.. figure:: /images/compass/insert-document-new-field.svg

Change Field Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can change the data type of a field by using the data type
selectors on the right of the field.

  :figwidth: 644px

To change the ``_id`` field to use a custom value, change
the data type from ``ObjectID`` to ``string`` and then overwrite the
``_id`` value:
