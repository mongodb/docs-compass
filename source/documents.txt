delete documents.

---------

.. note::

.. _view-documents:

View Documents
--------------

Use the Documents tab to view individual documents. When the Documents
tab loads, Compass displays all documents that match your query criteria
(or all documents within the sample if no query criteria was
specified).

.. _insert-documents:

Insert Documents
----------------

.. figure:: /images/compass/insert-button.png
  :figwidth: 816px

The insert dialog appears:

.. figure:: /images/compass/insert-document.png
  :figwidth: 598px

For each field in the document, select field type and fill in the
field name and value.

  :figwidth: 627px

.. tip::

   For the field values, you can paste valid JSON that can be parsed by
   JavaScript's ``JSON.parse``.
   
   - If the pasted JSON is an Array, the first character must be a left
     bracket ``[`` and the last character must be a right bracket ``]``:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        [ "first", "second", 3 ]
   
   - If the pasted JSON is an Object (i.e. a document), the keys must
     be quoted in double quotes and are permitted to be escaped. The
     first character must be left curly brace ``{`` and the last must
     be right curly brace ``}``:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        {
          "email": "test@example.com",
          "phone": "555-555-1212"
        }

Add New Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add a new field for the document, hover over the row number in the
dialog (the row number is not part of the document but the dialog
display) and click on the plus sign add a new field after the field.

.. figure:: /images/compass/insert-document-new-field.svg

Change Field Type

To change the ``_id`` field to use a custom value, change
the data type from ``ObjectID`` to ``string`` and then overwrite the
``_id`` value:

.. _clone-documents:

Clone Documents
---------------

It is also possible to insert new documents by cloning
the schema and values of an existing document in a collection.

To clone a document, hover over the desired document
and click the :guilabel:`Clone` button.

.. figure:: /images/compass/clone-doc.png
  :figwidth: 740px

This creates a new insert dialog with the same schema
and values. You can edit any of these fields and values before
you insert the new document.

You can now make changes to the fields, values, or data types
of values.

.. tip::

   For the field values, you can paste valid JSON that can be parsed by
   JavaScript's ``JSON.parse``.
   
   - If the pasted JSON is an Array, the first character must be a left
     bracket ``[`` and the last character must be a right bracket ``]``:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        [ "first", "second", 3 ]

     be quoted in double quotes and are permitted to be escaped. The
     first character must be left curly brace ``{`` and the last must
     be right curly brace ``}``:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        {
          "email": "test@example.com",
          "phone": "555-555-1212"
        }

yellow:

.. figure:: /images/compass/update-field.png
  :figwidth: 740px

When you are finished editing the document, click the ``Update`` button
to commit your changes. Compass performs a ``findAndModify`` operation
to update the document.

Reverting a Change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To revert a change to a field to its original value, click the revert
icon to the left of the field's line number.

Cancel Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Delete Documents
----------------

From the :guilabel:`Documents` view, you can delete documents by

.. figure:: /images/compass/delete-doc.png
  :figwidth: 740px

The document is marked for deletion and Compass

.. figure:: /images/compass/delete-doc2.png
  :figwidth: 740px

After you confirm, Compass deletes the document
from the collection.
