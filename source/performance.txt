Pause the Display
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Pause` button above the graph display pauses the update
of the displays only. Pausing the performance tab does not impact the
collection of the underlying data. To restart the display updates, click
:guilabel:`Play`.

Next to the :guilabel:`Pause` button is a clock which shows the
current time while the graphs are updating. If the display is
paused, the clock shows the time at which the pause began.
