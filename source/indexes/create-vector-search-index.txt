You can create :atlas:`Atlas Vector Search indexes 
</atlas-vector-search/vector-search-overview/>` using |compass|. These indexes 
enable you to index vector data *and* other data types, which facilitates 
semantic searches on the indexed fields. Atlas Vector Search indexes support 
indexing vector data by identifying the most similar vectors. The index 
determines similarity by calculating the distance between the query vector 
and the vectors stored in the index.

About this Task
---------------

To create an Atlas Search index, your deployment must align with one of the 
following cases:

- A deployment hosted on `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/>`__ and
  have an Atlas cluster tier of M10 or higher.

- A local deployment that is set up using the `Atlas CLI
  <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/cli/stable/atlas-cli-deploy-local/>`__.

Additionally, your deployment must run MongoDB version 7.0 or later.

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style: normal
   
   .. step:: Open the index creation dialog

      From the :ref:`Indexes <compass-indexes-tab>` tab, click the
      :guilabel:`Create` button and then click :guilabel:`Search Index`.

   .. step:: Specify a name for the index

   .. step:: Select the Atlas Search Index type

      Select :guilabel:`Vector Search`.

   .. step:: Provide the Atlas Vector Search Index configurations

      You must initially provide the following default vector search index 
      configurations. You can modify the configurations later.

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 20 10 70

         * - Field
           - Type
           - Description

         * - ``type``
           - string
           - Human-readable label that identifies the type of index. The value must 
             be ``vector`` to perform a vector search against the indexed fields. If 
             omitted, it defaults to ``filter``, which only supports full-text search.

         * - ``path``
           - string
           - The field name to index.
        
         * - ``numDimensions``
           - int 
           - The number of vector dimensions, which Atlas Search enforces at index- and 
             query-time. This value can't be greater than 4096.

         * - ``similarity``
           - string
           - The vector similarity function used to search for the top K-nearest neighbors.
             Select from the following functions:

             .. list-table::
                :header-rows: 1
                :widths: 50 50

                * - Function
                  - Description

                * - ``euclidean``
                  - A function that measures the distance between ends of vectors. This function 
                    allows you to measure similarity based on varying dimensions. 

                * - ``cosine``
                  - A function that measures similarity based on the angle between vectors. This 
                    function allows you to measure similarity that isn't scaled by magnitude. 
                    
                    You can't use zero magnitude vectors with cosine. To measure cosine similarity, 
                    we recommend that you normalize your vectors and use dotProduct instead.

                * - ``dotProduct``
                  -  A function that measures similarly to cosine, but takes into account the 
                     magnitude of the vector. This function allows you to efficiently measure 
                     similarity based on both angle and magnitude. To use dotProduct, you must 
                     normalize the vector to unit length at index- and query-time.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Create Search Index`

Example
-------

The following example definition uses the ``sample_mflix.embedded_movies`` collection 
and indexes the ``plot_embedding`` field to create an Atlas Vector Search index: 

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "fields": [ {
         "type": "vector",
         "path": "plot_embedding",
         "numDimensions": 1536,
         "similarity": "euclidean"
      } ]
   }

Results
-------

To view the status of your created index, go to the :guilabel:`Indexes`
tab and set the toggle at the top-right to :guilabel:`Search Indexes`.

The :guilabel:`Status` column indicates the status of the index. When
the status is :guilabel:`Ready`, your index is ready to use.

For more information on search index statuses, see
:ref:`search-index-status`.
