This page outlines how to use |compass| to connect to a
MongoDB host. You can connect to a standalone, replica set,
or sharded cluster host.

.. note:: MongoDB Atlas

   If you need to create a MongoDB host, consider using 
   `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_compass>`__.
   Atlas is a cloud-hosted database-as-a-service which requires no 
   installation, offers a free tier to get started, and provides a 
   copyable URI to easily connect |compass-short| to your deployment.

If you need to install |compass-short|, see
:ref:`download-install` for instructions.

Considerations
--------------

- When connecting |compass-short| to a replica set, it is not
  recommended to connect directly to an individual replica
  set member. If the member to which you are connected switches from a
  :manual:`primary </core/replica-set-primary/>` member to a
  :manual:`secondary </core/replica-set-secondary/>` or vice versa as
  the result of an election, |compass-short| may either forcibly close
  the connection or display stale data.

  Instead, to connect to a replica set, use either the replica set
  :guilabel:`SRV record` or :guilabel:`Replica Set Name` when 
  filling in your connection information.

Connect
-------

If your connection name is already in the :guilabel:`Connections
Sidebar` of your Compass window, click on the connection name to
connect. 

Otherwise, you can connect your deployments by either:

- Providing your connection string.

- Specifying :guilabel:`Advanced Connection Options`. 
  Advanced connection options allow you to specify authentication, 
  TLS/SSL, and SSH connection options. To learn more, see 
  :ref:`<advanced-connection-options>`.

Provide your Connection String
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you provide a connection string, |compass-short| supports
most :manual:`Connection String Options
</reference/connection-string/#connection-string-options>`
supported by MongoDB.

By default, |compass-short|'s default 
:manual:`socketTimeoutMS </reference/connection-string/#urioption.socketTimeoutMS>`
value is 60000, or 60 seconds. If you are frequently experiencing
timeouts in |compass-short|, consider setting this option to a
higher value in your connection string.

For a complete list of the connection string options that 
|compass-short| supports, see the
`Compass Connection README
<https://github.com/mongodb-js/connection-model/blob/master/README.md#properties>`__
on GitHub.
