*New in version 1.13.0*

|compass| provides the ability to import and export data to and
from your collections. Compass supports import and export for both
**JSON** and **CSV** files.

Import Data into a Collection
-----------------------------

|compass| can import data into a collection from either a
**JSON** or **CSV** file.

.. note::

   When importing data from a **JSON** file, each document must
   exist on its own line. There must also be a blank line at the end
   of the file, or the last document will not be inserted.

   The following example ``.json`` file imports three documents:

   .. cssclass:: copyable-code
   .. code-block:: javascript

      { "type": "home", "number": "212-555-1234" }
      { "type": "cell", "number": "646-555-4567" }
      { "type": "office", "number": "202-555-0182"}

   .. raw:: html

      <br>

   Because no
   :manual:`ObjectIDs </reference/method/ObjectId/>` are specified for
   these documents, |compass| automatically generates the
   ObjectIDs for these documents on import.

To import data into a collection:

1. Click :guilabel:`Collection` in the top-level menu and select
   :guilabel:`Import Data`.

   .. figure:: /images/compass/import-data-option-select.png
      :alt: Import data select menu

   .. raw:: html

      <br>

   |compass| displays the following dialog:

   .. figure:: /images/compass/import-data-dialog.png
      :alt: Import data dialog

2. Choose the appropriate file type and the location of the source data
   file.

3. Click :guilabel:`Import`.

A progress bar displays the status of the import. If an error occurs
during import, the progress bar turns red and an error message
appears in the dialog. After successful import, the dialog closes and
Compass displays the collection page containing the newly imported
documents.

Export Data from a Collection
-----------------------------

|compass| can export data from a collection as either a
**JSON** or **CSV** file. If you specify a query in the
:ref:`query bar <compass-query-bar>` prior to export, Compass can
optionally only export documents which match the specified query. If no
query is specified, Compass exports the entire collection.

To export collection data to a file:

1. Click :guilabel:`Collection` in the top-level menu and select
   :guilabel:`Export Collection`.

   .. figure:: /images/compass/export-data-option-select.png
      :alt: Export data select menu

   .. raw:: html

      <br>

   |compass| displays the following dialog:

   .. figure:: /images/compass/export-data-dialog.png
      :alt: Export data dialog

   The top section of the export dialog displays the query
   entered in the query bar prior to export which can be used to filter
   which collection documents are exported. If no query has been
   specified to the query bar, this section displays ``undefined``.

2. Use the toggle below the query filter to indicate whether to export
   only the documents matched by the query or the full collection.

   .. note::

      Having an ``undefined`` query filter and toggling the
      option to export the full collection both result in exporting
      the full collection.

3. Choose the appropriate file type and the location of the export file.

4. Click :guilabel:`Export`.

A progress bar displays the status of the export. If an error occurs
during export, the progress bar turns red and an error message
appears in the dialog. After successful export, the dialog closes.

The following example exports the entire collection as a ``.json`` file
called ``test-export.json``. Note that in this example there is a
query specified to the query bar of ``{ age: 24 }`` but we are
opting to ignore the query and export the full collection:
