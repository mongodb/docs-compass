*New in version 1.13.0*

|compass| provides the ability to import and export data to and
from your :doc:`collections </collections>`. Compass supports import
and export for both **JSON** and **CSV** files. To import or export
data to or from a collection, navigate to the detailed collection view
by either selecting the collection from the
:doc:`Databases </databases>` tab or clicking the collection in the
left-side navigation.

Import Data into a Collection
-----------------------------

|compass| can import data into a collection from either a **JSON** or
**CSV** file.

Format Your Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can import your data into |compass| you must first ensure
that it is formatted correctly.

.. tabs::

   tabs:
     - id: json
       name: JSON
       content: |

         When importing data from a **JSON** file, each document must exist on
         its own line in the file. Do not use commas at the end of lines to
         separate documents.

         .. example::

            The following ``.json`` file imports three documents:

            .. code-block:: javascript

               { "type": "home", "number": "212-555-1234" }
               { "type": "cell", "number": "646-555-4567" }
               { "type": "office", "number": "202-555-0182"}

            |compass| automatically generates :manual:`ObjectIDs
            </reference/method/ObjectId/>` for these objects on import
            since no ObjectIDs were specified in the initial JSON.

     - id: csv
       name: CSV
       content: |

         When importing data from a **CSV** file, the first line of the file
         must be a comma-separated list of your document field names. Subsequent
         lines in the file must be comma-separated field values in the order
         corresponding with the field order in the first line.

         .. example::

            The following ``.csv`` file imports three documents:

            .. code-block:: none

               name,age,fav_color,pet
               Jeff,25,green,Bongo
               Alice,20,purple,Hazel
               Tim,32,red,Lassie

            |compass| automatically generates :manual:`ObjectIDs
            </reference/method/ObjectId/>` for these objects on import
            since no ObjectIDs were specified in the initial CSV file.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

To import your formatted data into a collection:

.. include:: /includes/steps/import.rst

A progress bar displays the status of the import. If an error occurs
during import, the progress bar turns red and an error message
appears in the dialog. After successful import, the dialog closes and
Compass displays the collection page containing the newly imported
documents.

Export Data from a Collection
-----------------------------

|compass| can export data from a collection as either a
**JSON** or **CSV** file. If you specify a
:ref:`filter <query-bar-filter>` in the
:ref:`query bar <compass-query-bar>` prior to export, |compass-short|
can optionally only export documents which match the specified query.

Behavior
~~~~~~~~

While it is possible to exclude documents by using a query filter,
it is not possible to re-shape exported documents with a
:ref:`project <query-bar-project>` document. Even when you specify a
``project`` option in the query, |compass-short| still exports the
entire document.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

To export collection data to a file:

.. include:: /includes/steps/export.rst

A progress bar displays the status of the export. If an error occurs
during export, the progress bar turns red and an error message
appears in the dialog. After successful export, the dialog closes.

.. example::

   The following example exports the entire ``test.people`` collection
   as a ``.json`` file called ``test-export.json``:

   .. figure:: /images/compass/export-data-example.png
      :alt: Export data example

   .. note::

      The specified ``{ age: 24 }`` query is ignored and the entire
      collection is exported because the
      :guilabel:`Export Full Collection` toggle is enabled.
