Query Bar
=========

.. default-domain:: mongodb

From the various Collections tabs, you can use the query bar to specify
MongoDB queries.  For details, see :ref:`querying`.

.. figure:: /images/compass/query-bar-documents-view.png
   :figwidth: 805px

You can specify a query filter in the query bar. If you click 
:guilabel:`Options` to expand the query bar, you also have access to 
the ``project``, ``sort``, ``skip``, and ``limit`` options of the query.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 85

   * - Filter

     - Filter for the schema view.
	 
   * - `Project <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/project/>`_

     - The projection to determine the fields to return.  Specify the field and
       ``1`` to include a field or ``0`` to exclude a field.

   * - `Sort <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/sort/>`_

     - The sort order of the returned documents. To specify
       ascending order for a field, specify the field and ``1``.
       To specify descending order for a field, specify the field and ``-1``.

   * - `Skip <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/skip/>`_

     - The number of matching documents to skip before returning
       documents.

   * - `Limit <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/limit/>`_

     - The upper limit for the number of documents to return.

Filter
~~~~~~

You can type MongoDB queries into the query bar. In the filter
expression, you can use the various MongoDB :manual:`query operators
</reference/operator/query/>` except for the :query:`$text` query
operator.

.. tip:: 

   In the :doc:`Schema </schema>` tab, you can also use the :ref:`build-query`
   to enter a query into the query bar.

As you type, the :guilabel:`Find` button is disabled and the
:guilabel:`Filter` label turns red until a valid query is entered.
Filter syntax requires strict :manual:`extended JSON
</reference/mongodb-extended-json/>` types. To specify an
`ObjectID <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/ObjectId/>`_,
use the format ``{ "$oid": "<string>" }``, as in the following filter example:

.. example::
.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id": { "$oid": "58eee4f43d1a10a4e5339aac" } }

Project
~~~~~~~

If the query bar has the :guilabel:`Project` option, you can specify
which fields to return in the resulting data. By default, all fields
are returned.

To set projection, click :guilabel:`Options` and enter in the
projection document:

- To include fields, specify the field name and set to ``1`` in the
  project document:

  .. example::
  .. code-block:: javascript

     { year: 1, name: 1 }

  Only the fields specified in the project document (and the ``_id``
  field if it is not set to ``0`` in project document) are returned.
 
- To exclude fields, specify the field name and set to ``0`` in the
  project document:

  .. example::
  .. code-block:: javascript

     { year: 0, name: 0 }

  All fields except for the fields specified in the project document
  are returned.

.. note:: 

   With the exception of the ``_id`` field, you cannot specify both
   field inclusion and field exclusion in the project document. With
   the ``_id`` field, you can specify its exclusion in a project
   document that specifies field inclusions. For example, 
   ``{ year: 1, _id: 0 }``.

Sort
~~~~

If the query bar has the :guilabel:`Sort` option, you can specify the
sort order of the returned documents.

To set the sort order, click :guilabel:`Options` and enter in the sort
document:

To specify ascending order for a field, set the field to ``1`` in the sort 
document. To specify descending order for a field, set the field and ``-1`` 
in the sort documents. For example, the following sort document sorts 
results first by ``year`` in descending order, and within each year, 
sort by ``name`` in ascending order.

.. example::
.. code-block:: javascript

   { year: -1, name: 1 }

Skip
~~~~

If the query bar has the :guilabel:`Skip` option, you can specify the
first n-number of document to skip before returning the result set. To
specify the number of documents to skip, click :guilabel:`Options` and
enter the number to skip.

Limit
~~~~~

If the query bar has the :guilabel:`Limit` option, you can specify the
maximum number of documents to return. To specify the limit, click
:guilabel:`Options` and enter the limit.

Run the Query
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Click :guilabel:`Find` to run the query and view the updated results.

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/query-bar-results.rst

To clear the query bar and the results of the query, click :guilabel:`Reset`.
