From the various Collections tabs, you can use the query bar to specify
MongoDB queries.  For details, see :ref:`querying`.

.. figure:: /images/compass/query-bar-documents-view.png
   :figwidth: 720px

You can specify a query filter in the query bar. If you click
:guilabel:`Options` to expand the query bar, you also have access to
the ``project``, ``sort``, ``collation``, ``skip``, and ``limit``
options of the query.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 85

   * - :ref:`query-bar-filter`

     - The query.

   * - :ref:`query-bar-project`

     - The projection to determine the fields to return.  Specify the
       field and ``1`` to include a field or ``0`` to exclude a field.

   * - :ref:`query-bar-sort`

     - The sort order of the returned documents. To specify
       ascending order for a field, specify the field and ``1``.
       To specify descending order for a field, specify the field and ``-1``.

   * - :ref:`query-bar-collation`

     - The :manual:`collation </reference/collation/>` to use for the
       query. Use this option to specify language-specific rules for
       string comparison.

   * - :ref:`query-bar-skip`

     - The number of matching documents to skip before returning
       documents.

   * - :ref:`query-bar-limit`

     - The upper limit for the number of documents to return.

.. _querying:

Query Bar Options
-----------------

.. _query-bar-filter:

Filter
~~~~~~

You can type MongoDB queries into the query bar. In the filter
expression, you can use the various MongoDB :manual:`query operators
</reference/operator/query/>` except for the :query:`$text` query
operator.

.. tip::

   In the :doc:`Schema </schema>` tab, you can also use the :ref:`build-query`
   to enter a query into the query bar.

As you type, the :guilabel:`Find` button is disabled and the
:guilabel:`Filter` label turns red until a valid query is entered.
The Compass :guilabel:`Filter` supports using the :binary:`~bin.mongo`
shell mode representation of the MongoDB Extended JSON `BSON data types
<https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/mongodb-extended-json/#bson-data-types-and-associated-representations>`_.

.. example::

   The following filter returns documents where
   ``start_date`` is greater than than the BSON ``Date``
   ``2017-05-01``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { "start_date": {$gt: new Date('2017-05-01')} }

   By specifying the ``Date`` type in both ``start_date`` and the
   ``$gt`` comparison operator, Compass performs the ``greater
   than`` comparison chronologically, returning documents with
   ``start_date`` later than ``2017-05-01``.

   Without the ``Date`` type specification, Compass compares the
   ``start_dates`` as strings
   `lexicographically
   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order>`_,
   instead of comparing the values chronologically.

Filter by ObjectID
``````````````````

To specify an `ObjectID <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/ObjectId/>`_ in your filter,
use the format ``ObjectId('<id>')``, as in the following filter example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id": ObjectId('59a87101f17fcbfbc9cd4374') }

Query Bar Autocompletion
````````````````````````

The query bar autocompletes the current query based on the keys in
your collectionâ€™s documents, including keys in embedded
subdocuments.

.. _query-bar-project:

Project
~~~~~~~

If the query bar has the :guilabel:`Project` option, you can specify
which fields to return in the resulting data. By default, all fields
are returned.

To set projection, click :guilabel:`Options` and enter in the
projection document:

- To include fields, specify the field name and set to ``1`` in the
  project document, as in the following example:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { year: 1, name: 1 }

  Only the fields specified in the project document (and the ``_id``
  field if it is not set to ``0`` in project document) are returned.

- To exclude fields, specify the field name and set to ``0`` in the
  project document, as in the following example:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { year: 0, name: 0 }

  All fields except for the fields specified in the project document
  are returned.

.. note::

   With the exception of the ``_id`` field, you cannot specify both
   field inclusion and field exclusion in the project document. With
   the ``_id`` field, you can specify its exclusion in a project
   document that specifies field inclusions. For example,
   ``{ year: 1, _id: 0 }``.

For more information on projection, refer to the
:ref:`MongoDB Manual <find-projection>`.

.. _query-bar-sort:

Sort
~~~~

If the query bar has the :guilabel:`Sort` option, you can specify the
sort order of the returned documents.

To set the sort order, click :guilabel:`Options` and enter in the sort
document:

To specify ascending order for a field, set the field to ``1`` in the sort
document. To specify descending order for a field, set the field and ``-1``
in the sort documents. For example, the following sort document sorts
results first by ``year`` in descending order, and within each year,
sort by ``name`` in ascending order.

.. code-block:: javascript

   { year: -1, name: 1 }

For more information on sort, refer to the
:manual:`MongoDB Manual </reference/method/cursor.sort>`.

.. _query-bar-collation:

Collation
~~~~~~~~~

Use the :manual:`Collation </reference/collation/>` query bar option
to specify language-specific rules for string comparison, such as
rules for lettercase and accent marks.

Use the ``locale`` field in the collation document to specify the
`ICU Locale code <http://userguide.icu-project.org/locale>`_ for the
desired language. For a complete list of supported languages and
locales, refer to the :manual:`MongoDB Manual
</reference/collation-locales-defaults/#collation-languages-locales>`.

.. example::

   To use the ``pinyin`` variant of the Chinese collation, use the
   following collation document:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { "locale" : "zh@collation=pinyin" }

For a detailed list of all possible fields in a collation document,
refer to :manual:`the MongoDB Manual
</reference/collation/#collation-document-fields>`.

.. _query-bar-skip:

Skip
~~~~

If the query bar has the :guilabel:`Skip` option, you can specify the
first n-number of document to skip before returning the result set. To
specify the number of documents to skip, click :guilabel:`Options` and
enter the number to skip.

For more information on skip, refer to the :manual:`MongoDB Manual
</reference/method/cursor.skip>`.

.. _query-bar-limit:

Limit
~~~~~

If the query bar has the :guilabel:`Limit` option, you can specify the
maximum number of documents to return. To specify the limit, click
:guilabel:`Options` and enter the limit.

For more information on limit, refer to the
:manual:`MongoDB Manual </reference/method/cursor.limit>`.

Run the Query
-------------

Click :guilabel:`Find` to run the query and view the updated results.

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/query-bar-results.rst

To clear the query bar and the results of the query, click :guilabel:`Reset`.

Export the Query
----------------

*New in version 1.15.0*

|compass| supports exporting queries in a variety of languages for
use in applications utilizing the `MongoDB driver
<https://docs.mongodb.com/ecosystem/drivers/>`_ available for that
language. For details, see :ref:`Export Query to Specific Language
<compass-export-query>`.

.. _past-query-view:

Past Queries View
-----------------

Compass automatically stores up to 20 most recent queries for each
collection. To view these queries, click on the ellipsis
:guilabel:`(...)` button in the query bar, then click
:guilabel:`Toggle Query History`.

.. figure:: /images/compass/query-history-view.png

From the :guilabel:`Past Queries` view, you can view
:ref:`recent queries <recent-queries>` as well as
the queries saved as :ref:`favorites <favorite-queries>` for
the current collection.

.. _recent-queries:

Recent Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can view up to 20 most recent queries for that collection. Click on
a listed query to populate the query bar with that query.

.. figure:: /images/compass/query-history-select.png

You can also hover over a query and perform the following actions:

- Click the :guilabel:`Star` icon to save the query as a
  :ref:`favorite <favorite-queries>`. Specify a name for the query and
  click :guilabel:`Save`.

- Click the :guilabel:`Copy` icon to copy the query to the
  clipboard.

- Click the :guilabel:`Trash` icon to remove the query from the
  :guilabel:`Recent` list.

.. _favorite-queries:

Favorite Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the list of recent queries for a collection, you can save queries
as favorites. To view the list of queries saved as favorites, click on
:guilabel:`Favorites` in the past queries view.
