Delete Documents
================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. important::

   Deleting documents is not permitted in
   :guilabel:`MongoDB Compass Readonly Edition`.

Select the appropriate tab based on whether you are viewing your
documents in List, JSON, or Table view:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: List View
      :tabid: list-view

      To delete a document, hover over the document and click the
      :icon-fa5:`trash-alt` icon.

      .. figure:: /images/compass/delete-doc.png
        :figwidth: 720px

      After you click the delete button, the document is flagged for deletion.
      |compass-short| asks for confirmation that you want to remove the document:

      .. figure:: /images/compass/delete-doc2.png
        :figwidth: 720px

   .. tab:: JSON View
      :tabid: json

      .. note::

         JSON View is available starting in Compass 1.20.

      To delete a document, hover over the document and click the
      :icon-fa5:`trash-alt` icon.

      .. figure:: /images/compass/delete-doc-json.png
        :figwidth: 720px

      After you click the delete button, the document is flagged for deletion.
      |compass-short| asks for confirmation that you want to remove the document:

      .. figure:: /images/compass/delete-doc-json2.png
        :figwidth: 720px

   .. tab:: Table View
      :tabid: table-view

      To delete a document, hover over the document and click the
      :icon-fa5:`trash-alt` icon.

      .. figure:: /images/compass/table-view-delete.png

Once you confirm, Compass deletes the document from the collection.

Delete Multiple Documents
-------------------------

You cannot delete multiple documents at once from the |compass-short|
:abbr:`UI (User Interface)`. As an alternative, you can use the
:manual:`db.collection.deleteMany()
</reference/method/db.collection.deleteMany/>` method in the
:ref:`embedded MongoDB Shell <embedded-mongodb-shell>` to delete
multiple documents in a single operation.
